# Quake BSP in Unity

This is a highly experimental Unity project that has one job: render Quake 1 BSP levels. Of course to do that one thing it has to do a million little things.

## Installation

Download / clone this codebase into an empty directory. Open it in the Unity 3D game editor. Press "Play", see Quake. Developed and tested in Unity 5.6.5p4, which can be downloaded here:

## Disclaimers

Not the cleanest or best code I've ever written. I was simultaneously learning how Quake's BSP file format worked at the same time as learning Unity's API for constructing art assets at runtime. Still impressed by both Quake and Unity.

## Contributing

I'm sharing this code online in the hopes that someone else can learn from it, and that I can refer back to it when I need to remember how I did something. Feel free to clone / fork / branch this code to your heart's content. Send a pull request if you make something cool. No promises that there will be updates.
